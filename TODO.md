Current TODO list, any help with these is appreciated.

1. Teach bmaptool to update the alternate GPT partition
2. Add a test for bmap with invalid checksums
3. When writing to a file, and the file did not exist, so we create it,
   and then fail, we do not remove the half-written file.
4. Teach make_a_release.sh to modify the version in the 'doc/man1/bmaptool.1'
   file too.
5. Use __author__ and __version__ in bmaptool, and import them from
   'setup.py'
6. Move all the documentation from tizen.org to 01.org
7. Make sure the web documentation describes all features of releases starting
   from 3.1.
